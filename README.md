# NeuralNet

## Description
This project is Lua re-implementation of code samples from a blog entry by iamtrask at: http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/

## Examples
There are currently 3 samples.

* test.lua - Simple 2-layer neural network for 4 data samples.
* bitmap_test.lua - This sample contains bitmap recognition with simple output value for each data sample.
* bitmap_test_mr.lua - Extended sample from bitmap_test.lua with multiple output values for each data sample.
